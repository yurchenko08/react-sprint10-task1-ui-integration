# Task: UI Integration

This is a small app for listing blog posts.
The state tree stores a list of blog posts and a list of authors.
Each post entry has an author ID associated.

There're two main components: `PostsList` and `NewPostForm`. Both of them need access to the Redux store.
The component `PostsList` needs to display a list of posts with the right author details,
and the `NewPostForm` needs to let the application user select a post author and dispatch an action containing the new post title and the author ID.

The app has a working store set up, and already imported into both component files.
Use `store.getState()` to copy data from the store into the initial component state,
as well as `store.subscribe()` and `getState()` to get the updated values from the store so the component can call `setState()` and re-render as needed.
